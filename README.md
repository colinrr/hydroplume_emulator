# katlaPlumePhysicsEmulator


This repository contains combined matlab and python code for a random-forest-based emulator of convective plume physics.

I used a dataset generated by 30,000 simulated outputs of a convective plume to train and test. the random forest. 

More complete documentation to come as I finalize and package the code!
